# IBM Packer Plugin
The IBM packer plugin creates Image template(.VHD) with pre-configured OS and installed softwares on IBMCloud 

# Easy Mode
This repo contains a few extra scripts to help you on your way, to use packer with IBM Cloud.

First, just run the build script:

```
./build.sh
```

The build script will build the packer plugin for ibm, for each main operating system.

Inside `./output/`, you fill find support for darwin, linux & windows.

Select the appropriate file for your operating system and move to the ~/packer.d/plugins/ directory.

## MacOS
```
cp output/packer-builder-ibmcloud-darwin ~/.packer.d/plugins/packer-builder-ibmcloud
```

## Linux 
```
cp output/packer-builder-ibmcloud-linux ~/.packer.d/plugins/packer-builder-ibmcloud
```


## IBM Packer Builder
The builder takes a source OS base Linux or Windows image (identified by it's global ID), provisions an Instance, adds additional applications & services to it and generates an Image Template out of the Instance on different platforms. These generated Images can be reused to launch new VSI Instances within IBMCloud.
The builder does not manage VSI images. Once it creates an image, it is up to you to use it or delete it.

## IBM Packer Provisioner
The provisioners use builtin software or software like ansible to install packages or configure the Image after booting

## IBM Packer Post-Provisoners
Post-processors are optional, and they can be used to upload artifacts.

## Installation  

### Using a Docker Container  
1. Build the script from Dockerfile   
   `$ docker build -t ibmcloud/packer-plugin-ibmcloud .`   
2. Check image is in the local Docker image registry  
   `$ docker image ls`
3. Run and interact with the container  
   ```
   $ docker run -it ibmcloud/packer-plugin-ibmcloud /bin/bash    
   $ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/ibmcloud/packer-builder-ibmcloud
   ```
4. Copy your SSH key pair and give proper permission access.    
   ```
   $ mkdir -p $HOME/.ssh
   $ vi $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa
   -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY----- ...

   $ vi $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
   ssh-rsa AAAA ...   

   $ chmod 600 $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa
   $ chmod 600 $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa.pub  
   ```
5. Update .env file with your IBM Cloud credentials  
   ```
   $ vi .env

   export IBM_API_KEY=""
   export ANSIBLE_INVENTORY_FILE="provisioner/hosts"
   export ANSIBLE_HOST_KEY_CHECKING=False

5) **IBM Cloud Packer-Builder**

   Clone this repository 
   ```
   $ mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/ibmcloud  
   $ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/ibmcloud  
   
   # main repo
   $ git clone https://github.com/IBM/packer-plugin-ibmcloud.git packer-builder-ibmcloud
   $ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/ibmcloud/packer-builder-ibmcloud  

   # Install dependencies for Generate the HCL2 code of a plugin
   $ go get github.com/cweill/gotests/...  
   $ go install github.com/hashicorp/packer/cmd/mapstructure-to-hcl2  
   $ mv $GOPATH/src/github.com/hashicorp/packer/vendor/github.com/hashicorp/hcl $GOPATH/src/github.com/hashicorp  
   $ go generate ./builder/ibmcloud/...
   ```

   Build the plugin
   ```
   $ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/ibmcloud/packer-builder-ibmcloud
      
   # make sure you update the version under version/version.go if code has changes/features are added 
   # Eg - current version is 0.1.0. When a new feature added to plugin then the new version should be 0.1.1
   
   $ go build
   ```

   **Important Note - Save your existing SSH keypair(id_rsa and is_rsa.pub) before you run Packer. Ansible provisioner is going to overwrite SSH keypair with its own.**
  
   Create .env file:
   ```
   $ cat $GOPATH/src/github.com/ibmcloud/packer-builder-ibmcloud/.env
   export SL_USERNAME="devtest@.ibm.com"
   export SL_API_KEY="f940986bdfcc34....7fb50b23e3c77acae"
   export ANSIBLE_INVENTORY_FILE="provisioner/hosts"
   export PRIVATEKEY="$HOME/.ssh/id_rsa" <<<< Specific to linux plugin with ansible support
   export PUBLICKEY="$HOME/.ssh/id_rsa.pub" <<<< Specific to linux plugin with ansible support
   export ANSIBLE_HOST_KEY_CHECKING=False
   export PACKER_LOG=1
   export PACKER_LOG_PATH="packerlog.txt"
   export OBJC_DISABLE_INITIALIZE_FORK_SAFETY=YES  <<<< Specific to MAC client 
   ```

   Run Packer:
   ```
   $ source .env

   # Edit the json file with proper mandatory and optional feilds 
   
   $ packer validate examples/linux.json or examples/windows.json
   $ packer build examples/linux.json or examples/windows.json
   ```

   If you are willing to use your own image as your starting point, you can specify `base_image_id` instead of `base_os_code`.

## Configuration Reference
